"""Tap/query single-`final` SSE stream, extracted from generate._event_stream.

The default path: resolve the click to a subject (unless prefetched), plan the
page, split the op via model_router.select_operation (enter_scene /
zoom_continue / fresh), render — judged render loop on deliberate-camera
enters, draft+main dual-task drive on the fresh path — then ground and stream
the single `final` frame. Behaviour is byte-identical to the former inline
block; generate.py's stream helpers and view/geometry/grounding helpers
(`_sse`, `_abort_if_disconnected`, `_condition_url_for_role`, `_view_spec_for`,
`_run_grounding`, ...) are threaded in as parameters, and the cumulative loop
deadline derives from the caller's `started` + `ingress_timeout_s`.
