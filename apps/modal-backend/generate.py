"""Endless Canvas — page generation service (FastAPI on Modal).

Exposes `POST /sse/generate` as an SSE stream. The Next.js web app proxies to
this endpoint. Flow:

1. If `mode == "tap"`, resolve click coords to a subject phrase via the VLM.
2. Plan the page (title, prompt, facts) via the text LLM with optional

3. Call fal-ai nano-banana with the composed prompt.
4. Emit SSE events: `progress` (placeholder, for future progressive models)
